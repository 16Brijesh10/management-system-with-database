         Branch VARCHAR(255),
         Dept VARCHAR(255)
     );
     ```

2. **Python Dependencies:**

     ```
     pip install mysql-connector-python
     ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Clone the repository.
   - Navigate to the directory containing your Python script.
   - Execute the script (`python your_script.py`).
